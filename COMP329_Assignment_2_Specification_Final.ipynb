    "The permutation `(1, 2, 3)` represents the tour that goes from 1 to 2 to 3 and back to 1.  You may have noticed that there aren't really six different tours of three cities: the cities 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle;  any tour must connect the three points of the triangle; and there are really only two ways to do this: clockwise or counterclockwise.   In general, with $n$ cities, there are $n!$ (that is, $n$ factorial) permutations, but only  $(n-1)!$,  tours that are *distinct*: the tours `123`, `231`, and `312` are three ways of representing the *same* tour.\n",

    "The game of Tic Tac Toe (2D) is played on a 3 by 3 grid.  One player marks her squares with an X, and the other with an O.  The players alternate, placing their marks on an empty cell on the grid with the hope of winning the game.  The winner of the game is the first player to place 3 of their marks in a line (row, column, and diagnoal).  If the entire grid is filled with marks, and there is no winner, the game is declared a draw.  Your task is to create a player to play the 3D version of this game without any knowledge of strategies for playing Tic Tac Toe.  The only rule that is known to this evolving player is that the players alternate their turns, and when it is the evolving player’s turn, it could only place its own mark on an empty spot in the grid. We have already implemented Negamax algorithm to play 3D tic-tac-toe in one of the practicals. In this assignment, we try to solve 3D (3 x 3 x 3) Tic-Tac-Toe game using Genetic Algorithm (GA). "
